# Express LocalLibrary Tutorial

A tutorial-based web application for managing a local library's catalog using Node.js and Express.js. ðŸ“š

---

This project showcases an online catalog system for a small local library. It allows users to browse books and view detailed information. The project is based on the [MDN Local Library tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website), with custom enhancements and learnings incorporated during development.

## Key Features âœ¨

- **Book Browsing:** View available books, authors, genres, and detailed information for each item.
- **Dynamic Web Pages:** Developed using Pug templates for server-side rendering.
- **RESTful APIs:** Includes endpoints to interact with the database seamlessly.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Uses Mongoose for object data modeling and MongoDB Atlas for cloud-based database hosting.

## Quick Start ðŸš€

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/development_environment)
- A MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based via [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yassinekrn/express-locallibrary-tutorial.git
   cd express-locallibrary-tutorial
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up your environment variables (if using a custom database):
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add the following:
     ```env
     MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
     DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:*
     ```

### Run the Server

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   DEBUG=express-locallibrary-tutorial:* npm run devstart

   # Windows Powershell
   $ENV:DEBUG = "express-locallibrary-tutorial:*"; npm start
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/
   ```
